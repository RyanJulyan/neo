# Neo
### Modular isomorphic Fluxible web application platform

> Warning: This project is in very early development phase. Certainly no where near production ready... yet.

Neo is a nu-generation web application platform. Neo presents a modular and pluggable architecture, designed to be 
composable, flexible and scalable.

Although Neo prescribes an opinionated project structure and Flux pattern - it favours convention over configuration and 
does not aim to be another full fat framework - rather a pluggable platform, allowing you to plug the features your app, 
or cluster of apps, require.
